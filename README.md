# Maze-generator
Maze generator and solver done using a customized version of Recursive backtracking algorithm. 

# Single.py 
Uses a single generator and a single solver.

# Multiple.py 
Uses two generators and three solvers(Red, Green, Blue).
The Recursive backtracking algorithm in this case is modified to fit working with two generators in parallel and three solvers in parallel.

# Visualization
Using pygame.
